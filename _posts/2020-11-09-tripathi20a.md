title: Learning Discriminative Features using Center Loss and Reconstruction as Regularizer
  for Speech Emotion Recognition
abstract: This paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inspired by Multitask
  Learning (MTL) and based on speech features trained under the joint supervision
  of softmax loss and center loss, a powerful metric learning strategy, for the recognition
  of emotion in speech. Speech features such as Spectrograms and Mel-frequency Cepstral
  Coefficients (MFCCs) help retain emotion related low-level characteristics in speech.
  We experimented with several Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures that take in
  speech features as input and trained them under both softmax and center loss, which
  resulted in highly discriminative features ideal for Speech Emotion Recognition
  (SER). Our networks also employ a regularizing effect by simultaneously performing
  the auxiliary task of reconstructing the input speech features. This sharing of
  representations among related tasks enables our network to better generalize the
  original task of SER. Some of our proposed networks contain far fewer parameters
  when compared to state-of-the-art architectures. We used the University of Southern
  Californiaâ€™s Interactive Emotional Motion Capture (USC-IEMOCAP) database in this
  work. Our best performing model achieves a 3.1% improvement in overall accuracy
  and a 5.3% improvement in class accuracy when compared to existing state-of-the-art
  methods.
