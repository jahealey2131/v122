title: Measuring Two-People Communication from Omnidirectional Video
abstract: 'In this paper we propose a method of measuring the communication between
  two people by analyzing their headsâ€™ information: head pose, gaze vectors and facial
  action units. Assuming two people are sitting around a table, an omnidirectional
  camera is used to observe the two people simultaneously.Next, the visual cues of
  the heads of the two people, including head pose, gaze vectors and facial action
  units, are extracted using a popular facial behavior analysis toolkit, OpenFace.
  Then,  a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural network is used to learn measuring
  the communication between the two people from the temporal sequence of the extracted
  head information. The preliminary experimental results show the effectiveness of
  the proposed method.'
