title: 'Sequential Dependence and Non-linearity in Affective Responses: a Skin Conductance
  Example'
abstract: 'Individual affective responses frequently vary from the mean and often
  exhibit non-linear and time and sequence dependent properties.  This paper examines
  the extent to which commonly made assumptions of linearity and sequential independence
  are valid using skin conductance responses to an acoustic stimulus as an example.  We
  present 19 sessions of skin conductance traces where participants respond to five
  50 millisecond acoustic bursts designed to elicit a startle.  We show the data from
  the perspective of an online algorithm: individual responses, non-linear and dependent
  on prior events.  We show that the coefficient of variation depends on sequence
  position and that these are large at 65%, 97%, 110%, and 100%.  We discuss the risk
  of making inferences on single impressions.'
